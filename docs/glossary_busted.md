### Summary Statistics

* **number of sequences** - the number of sequences present in the input file
* **number of variants** - the number of variants present in the input file
* **number of total branches** - the total number of branches in the phylogeny
* **number of foreground branches** - the number of branches in the phylogeny that are selected for inclusion in the foreground partition as described in Murrell et al., 2015 (Mol. Biol. Evol. 32:1365)
* **number of background branches** - the number of branches in the phylogeny that are selected for inclusion in the background partition as described in Murrell et al., 2015 (Mol. Biol. Evol. 32:1365)

### BUSTED results summary
* **LRT** - likelihood ratio test implemented as described in Murrell et al., 2015 (Mol. Biol. Evol. 32:1365)
* **ω** - the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution

### Model Fits Table

* **unconstrained model** - a model that allows branches to be split into foreground and background partitions. Each partition includes three categories of ω such that ω<sub>1</sub> <= ω<sub>2</sub> <= ω<sub>3</sub>

* **constrained model** - an alternate null model in which ω<sub>3</sub>=1 in the foreground partition

* ***log* L** - log likelihood estimate of the respective model

* **\# par.** - the number of parameters in the model

* **AIC<sub>c</sub>**  - small-sample Akaike Information Criterion (Sigiura, 1978, Commun. Stat. Theory Methods, A7:13) 

* **L<sub>tree</sub>** - [[add in definition when available]]

* **branch set** - the branch set partition used; FG represents foreground and BG represents background

### Model Evidence Ratios Per Site
